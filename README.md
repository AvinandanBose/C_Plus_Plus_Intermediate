<h1> Pointers and Pointer Arithmetic </h1>
<h3> A pointer is a entity which cointains a memory address and specified location of computer memory. </h3>
<h3> Suppose integer i = 10 which has address in the memory location FFFF4 and *p is a pointer which assigned to address of integer i  through & → address operator. Now if we makes output of *p we get 10 i.e *p which contains address of i i.e. FFFF4 points to that address and fetch the value from that address. </h3> 

<h3><ins>Dereferencing operator(*)/Indirection Operator(*)</ins> :→ Dereferencing is an operation  performed to access and manipulate data contained in the memory location 'pointed to' by a pointer. The operator '*' is used to deference pointers. </h3>

<h3><i> Similarly,  *ptr is a pointer variable and ptr=&i and *ptr = 20 , then 20 is saved to address of variable i which is possible only because of dereferencing operator. </i></h3>
